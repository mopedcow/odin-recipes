    <h2>Description</h2>
    This is a version of sausage marinara with rice instead of pasta. I can't find the original recipe but it's ok, we make this all the time so i remember the steps pretty well. I am a recipe blogger. This makes enough for 2 people who eat a lot, but they save a bit for leftovers because they are trying to get better at portioning.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sausages. Some kind of Italian sausage is best</li>
        <li>1 onion, or One-ion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers, whichever color you like, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tin peeled plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 jar tomato passata</li>
        <li>Lots of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp ground basil</li>
        <li>1-ish Tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Harissa paste (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup rice--Basmati is best (imo)</li>
        <li>Oil for frying (canola or sunflower)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the sausages in a bit of oil until almost cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove the sausage. Ask your partner to slice them up into bite-sized pieces while you do the next step</li>
        <li>Fry the garlic and onion until the onion is almost soft, then add the bell pepper.</li>
        <li>Also start to cook the rice. I always forget when is the best time to do this.</li>
        <li>When the pepper is soft, add the sausage back to the pan along with the tinned tomatoes and passata</li>
        <li>Add the lemon juice, basil, salt and pepper. Add the harrissa paste too, if using.</li>
        <li>Once everything's hot and flavorful and the sausage is cooked through, turn off the heat. Add the rice and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Serve with garlic bread or something</li>
    </ol>
