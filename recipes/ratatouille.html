    <h1>Ratatouille</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    An easy to make version of a delicious French dish. Aubergine, courgette, onion, garlic and tomato are first saut√©ed in oil then combined, with the addition of basil and/or oregano. I like to add tomato sauce and pour it on top of spaghetti. It's good!! This recipe should make enough for 2 hungry people with a bit left over for lunch tomorrow.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Courgettes, chopped big</li>
        <li>1 Aubergine, chopped big</li>
        <li>1 medium brown onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3-4 small or 2 big tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 jar tomato passata</li>
        <li>Lots of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
        <li>2-ish Tbsp Basil</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp Oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Enough spaghetti for 2</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the aubergine until it's browned. The pieces should be firm--no need to cook thouroughly yet. Remove from pan, then do the same with the courgette. Remove the courgette.</li>
        <li>Fry the garlic and onion until it's soft. Then add the aubergine and courgette back to the pan</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, passata, basil, oregano, and salt and pepper. Cook thouroughly until hot and the veg are soft.</li>
        <li>I forgot to tell you to cook the pasta. Do that.</li>
        <li>Serve the saucy ratatouille over the pasta, top with parmesan.</li>
        <li>PS you could also add bell peppers if you want. Chop and cook the same way as the aubergine and courgette.</li>
    </ol>
